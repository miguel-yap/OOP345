My reflection on this project is pretty simple: it was tough in a way that felt very real. This wasn’t just another class exercise so I had a lot of help from AI. The first big hurdle was handling the CustomerOrder objects. Moving them around without accidentally deleting something or leaving behind bad pointers was harder than I expected. Every “move” had to be handled carefully.

The next challenge was untangling how the assembly line worked. Getting the LineManager and the Workstations to pass orders correctly felt like solving a puzzle where the pieces kept shifting. When an order got stuck because a station ran out of stock, the whole program would loop forever. The test didn’t make it easier it expected a very specific behavior that wasn’t obvious at first, so I had to adjust my logic just to match what it wanted.

Even though it was frustrating at times, getting everything running smoothly and without memory leaks felt really rewarding. I walked away understanding how small details in C++ can turn into big issues, and how satisfying it is when all the moving parts finally work together.
